================

Well.. If you are already trying to read this, I guess you are in need to implement a google powered search engine to your website.
For a requirement like that moving through coding seperate search box and rendering results is complete old school.This plugin will do what you exactly wanted to implement.
Just give it a try and say hello to your brand new google search engine exclusive for your website.


**You will find this package useful if you are,**

1. A web developer (quite obvious it is)
2. A TYPO3 Integrator/ Editor
3. Searching restlessly in internet to implement a custom search for your website
4. And finally you need to render the only results from your website by avoiding all other gibberish

Don't skip the rest..

**Your requirements to play with this extension**

1. A TYPO3 Instance
2. Your need for the above explained scenario
3. An active google account (Yes.! You really need this pal. )

Done ? Then you are good to go..

		ALL HAIL GOOGLE
